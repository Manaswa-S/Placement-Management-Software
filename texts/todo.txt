update routesDoc file

get other details from user such as IP address to implement rate limiting and better security

Enable Go's pprof HTTP server for runtime profiling:

introduce concurrency

refresh token is useless as of now

handler functions are structed wrong, need to use gin.HandlerFunc

in myapplicants or similar pages, you might want to reduce the info directly in cards and instead direct to profile pages for info

we havent accounted for sections in test forms

for everything there is not a check if the time for that event has gone by, i can still give tests that were meant to be over by yesterday

in the public.ConfirmSignup , we send a valid JWT token directly, which is ... stupid!

there are alot of endpoints like /company/editcutoff that need to be rate limited heavily

in logger if 'explicit_error' is true, log it as CRITICAL error in a separate area

custom 'alert' ui

need to attach all internal/critical errors to the context so that they can be logged

implement TTL to all data in redis for automatic cleanup

add a safety measure that saves all redis cache data before shutting down

none of our endpoints are type safe, you can send illegal data and it will still proceed, the checks are only for the client side

there is currently no mechanism to evaluate subjective questions

there should be a created_at in every table

you can send multiple extrainfo post requests from one link, it does not check for duplicates

new job form needs refactoring, there are redundant fields like company name and email, etc

start test, go back and change page, the test will never be submitted, the time might be up, but the end_time is never updated

restructure the template folder

alot of the earlier functions have alot of inefficiency that needs to be fixed\

rate limit on file uploads separately

change boiler plate names in email templates, etc

replace the 'var name struct' with new() asap

include profile pic feature for all

nice and smaller (size) favicon  

consider the fact that the browser caches test questions anyway, so whats the point of one-q-at a time

new test email, results, etc

Interview Conflict: Ensure that there is logic in place to check for conflicts before scheduling an interview.
Rescheduling: Provide a way for the company to reschedule the interview in case of an issue 

the myapplicants page refreshes EVERYTHING everytime an action is performed (shortlist/ etc)

later on add edit functions in applications

user cannot apply for any further jobs when he has been hired for atleast one job and similar constraints

set a timer to delete the rejected/offered/hired applications after 7 days



















there should be a notifications thing for every role

the interview process should be variable

after singup as admin it still sends a company extra info , the methods consider only two roles (company or student) and misbehave for anything else
